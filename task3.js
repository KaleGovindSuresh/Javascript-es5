
// Problem 2:
// Complexity: Medium

// You have been given a set of integers. You need to write a program that will divide a set 
// in two subsets of n/2 sizes each such that the difference of the sum of two subsets is as
//  minimum as possible.

// Note: n is even, hence sizes of two subsets must be strictly n/2.

// For example,

// Input =  [3, 4, 5, 3, 100, 1, 83, 54, 23, 20]
// Output = [3, 5, 3, 83, 54] and [4, 100, 1, 23, 20].
// Also print the sum of each set.

// Both output subsets are of size 5 and sum of elements in both subsets is same (148 and 148).
